# Car v Jet

## TODO (eventually):

Jet:
- [x] Basic controls (roll, pitch, yaw, thrust, shoot)
- [ ] Camera control + recentering
- [x] Basic physics (lift, drag, thrust, gravity)
- [ ] verify stall angle works
- [ ] Crashing
- [x] Basic shooting
- [ ] Bullets need to check an explosion radius on impact
- [ ] Nearby explosions should push the car around, not apply too much damage
- [x] Basic HUD (target reticule)
- [ ] Horizon indicator

Environment:
- [ ] Roads
- [ ] Buildings

Misc
- [ ] Music
- [ ] HUD overhaul
- [ ] Menus (main menu, pause menu, setting menu)
